ACT I

SCENE I. Elsinore. A platform before the castle.

오성이 at his post. Enter to him BERNARDO

BERNARDO:
Who's there?

오성이:
Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.

BERNARDO:
Long live the king!

오성이:
Bernardo?

BERNARDO:
He.

오성이:
You come most carefully upon your hour.

BERNARDO:
'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.

오성이:
For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
And I am sick at heart.

BERNARDO:
Have you had quiet guard?

오성이:
Not a mouse stirring.

BERNARDO:
Well, good night.
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.

오성이:
I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?
